                    Hello World, my name is Kevin. <br>
                    I served in the US military from 2013 to 2017, during which I deployed across the Pacific, Djibouti, Kuwait, and Syria. This time of my life, for many reasons, affected the trajectory I've been on for the past decade. Visiting Singapore in 2016, for example, sparked my curiosity with environmental and infrastructure studies. While I didn't end up majoring in these curiosities, I did take classes to learn more about them, which furthered my path into engineering. After leaving the service in 2017, I started attending a local community college and, after 2 years, transferred to Stanford where I majored in Engineering: Product Design.
                    <br> Harnessing some of the skills I learned in my undergraduate studies, I landed a role in tech sales at DocuSign in 2022. While at DocuSign, I learned all about the customer side of SaaS solutions, particularly in the financial sector, and how creating and evaluating solutions through process design is generally conducted. Additionally, I learned that I enjoyed interpreting and relaying information through numbers, and would often go out of my way to write Google Apps Scripts to format data to better aid my teams' processes. This realization is one of the contributing factors that led me to the MIMS program. Lately, I have been interested in mathematics and would like to pursue more of how it intersects with information theory and vice versa.
